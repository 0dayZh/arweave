# Archain Server

This repository holds the Archain server prototype, as well as the App Developer
Toolkit (ADT) and the Archain testing framework, TNT/NO-VLNS.

Archain is a distributed, cryptographically verified permanent archive built
on a cryptocurrency that aims to, for the first time, provide feasible data
permanence. By leveraging our novel Blockweave datastructure, data is stored
in a decentralised, peer-to-peer manner where miners are incentivised to
store rare data.

# Requirements

In order to run the Archain server prototype and ADT, a recent (R20 and above)
version of Erlang/OTP is required as well as a version of make.

# Getting Started
To get started, simply download this repo. You can start an Archain server
session simply by running `make session`.

You can learn more about building Archain ADT apps by checking out our
documentation [here](ADT_README.md).

You can also find detailed tutorials about building Archain apps and services
on the [Archain youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdM3INQ5NAsNjWU8-2y_xjw).

For more information on the Archain project and to read our whitepaper visit
[Archain.org](https://www.archain.org/).

Caution: Archain is in active development. Please be aware that the API for the
Archain ADT will likely be added to such that the current state is a subset
of its future capabilities.

# Ubuntu/Debian Linux Quickstart
You can download the Archain codebase, all dependencies and start mining
straight away by opening a terminal and running:

`curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jxs1/5e5b3dacb775f8e34fea0a7fc7fa3a69/raw/aafe996b788a30250547aad792094260472b3bfe/install_archain_and_mine.sh | bash && cd archain && ./archain-server peer XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX mine`

Donâ€™t forget to change xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to the IP address you should have
received in the backer email you received on November the 7th.


# TNT/NO-VLNS
TNT (Tiny Network Tests) and NO-VLNS (Never Off Very Large Network Simulator)
are the two halves of Archain's testing suite.

You can launch TNT by running `make tnt` and NO-VLNS by running `make no-vlns`.

More information on [TNT](https://medium.com/@archain/tnt-exploding-edge-case-bugs-42a36c36f15e) and [NO-VLNS](https://medium.com/@archain/no-vlns-simulating-huge-archain-networks-on-a-single-machine-d34bccf5045b) can be found on our [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@archain).
